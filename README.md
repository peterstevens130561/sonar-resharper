sonar-resharper
===============

This is an evolution of the 4.5.1 resharper plugin. It supports custom severities settings, which is useful in an environment 
where ReSharper is leading. It also allows to set platform and configuration, though these properties have been
deprecated.

Still uses the 3.7 SonarQube, so will move that up in the next RC.

Verified both with and without the VisualStudio Bootstrapper.
